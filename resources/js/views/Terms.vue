                <h4>11.	Limitation of Liability </h4>
                <p>
                    COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR
                    LOSS (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR THE LIKE), WHETHER BASED ON
                    BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE
                    COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES
                    DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
                    SO THIS LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, THE RESPECTIVE LIABILITY
                    OF THE COMPANY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH STATE LAW. The limited warranty,
                    exclusive remedies and limited liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of
                    the bargain between the Company and you. You agree that the Company would not be able to provide
                    the Website without such limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the Company shall have no responsibility if the Website has been altered in any way,
                    or for any failure that arises out of use of the Website with other than a recommended hardware
                    configuration, platform or operating system.
                </p>
                <h4>12. Indemnification</h4>
                <p>
                    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Company, its successors and assigns, directors, officers,
                    employees, representatives, agents, licensors, advertisers, suppliers and operational service
                    providers harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses
                    (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “Claims”), arising in any way out of
                    or in connection with (a) your use of the Website, (b) your breach or violation these Terms
                    of Service or (c) your Content. The Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume
                    the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you,
                    and in such case, you agree to cooperate with the Company’s defense of such Claim.
                    This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of
                    the Website.
                </p>
                <h4>13.	Modification</h4>
                <p>
                    The Company reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, these Terms of Service
                    and all documents incorporated by reference.  You can always find the most recent version of
