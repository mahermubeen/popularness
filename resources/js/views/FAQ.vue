                            effect. So continue to share and share and share discoveries with your friends and family.

                            See music videos are pretty unique, they aren't dictated by dollars or
                            programmers (like at radio stations). So when a fan watches the videos they actually
                            like to watch without dictatorship, it gives the artist tremendous insight on their
                            effect. So continue to share and share and share discoveries with your friends and family.
