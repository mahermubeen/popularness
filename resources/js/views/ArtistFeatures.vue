                <h3>Here’s a Toast to Money Making Music Videos</h3>
                <p>You’re among the new breed of Artists disrupting traditional record labels.
                    You have the creative control to showcase your music videos how you see fit,
                    you’re handpicking your own in-house team members to build your empire, and
                    don’t give a damn about a 360 deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You use the Internet, social media, and digital music services to distribute your music,
                    communicate with fans, sell merch, and ultimately book shows around the world.
                    Between record sales plummeting and battling for fair royalties, touring and doing shows is what
                    keeps the lights on. Knowing that, we became fully committed to figuring out a way to help.
                    It doesn’t solve all the music industry woes, but it’s a start.
                </p>
                <h4>OUR START.</h4>
                <p>
                    We’ve developed an innovative platform for Fans to tip your music videos they connect with.
                    It’s their way of showing love and appreciation. Each month, you will receive 100% of all the tips
                    from your catalog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raise your glasses to 100%, 100, hundred, hunnid, hundo…
                    <br>
                    (Now if you can’t respect that your whole perspective is wack)
